Indigo: A Hierarchical MVC PHP 3.5+ Framework
---------------------------------------------

* Lightweight
* Full OOP
* PHP 5.3+
* HMVC as easy as it gets (by calling just one method)
* Dynamic templating system (native PHP for the time being)
* DRY
* KISS
* MongoDB powered (no support for a relational database as of now)
* Modular Separation (instead of files all stored in huge controllers/views/models directories)
* Nested modularity (submodules may extend parent modules)
